    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our task management app, designed to help teams collaborate efficiently.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Imagine you're a team leader overseeing a project. You can assign tasks to team members, set deadlines, and track progressâ€”all in one place.</p>

    <h3>Example Scenario</h3>
    <p>Ali, the team leader, assigns a task to Sara:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Task:</strong> Develop the user authentication module.</li>
        <li><strong>Assigned To:</strong> Sara</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Sara gets notified, updates the status as she progresses, and submits the task for review once completed.</p>
